## **Features**

### **For Patients**
1. **X-Ray Analysis and Highlighting**:
   - Upload chest X-rays and use AI (CAD4TB) to assign a TB probability score.
   - Differentiate between active TB infections and scarring.

2. **Personalized Treatment Guidance**:
   - AI-powered recommendations based on patient-specific data (e.g., symptoms, weight, diagnosis).

3. **Patient Education & Precautions**:
   - Multimedia materials (videos, text, infographics) explaining TB prevention, transmission, and treatment adherence.
   - Multilingual support (Kannada, English, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam).

4. **Medication Adherence Tracking**:
   - Daily reminders for medication intake.
   - Visual progress tracking for treatment milestones.

5. **Self-Monitoring**:
   - Tools to report medication side effects like nausea, fatigue, or severe symptoms.
   - Healthcare providers are alerted if required.

6. **Social Support System**:
   - Anonymous discussion forums for patients to share experiences and receive emotional support.

### **For Healthcare Workers**
1. **Patient Records**:
   - Access all patients' X-ray images, reports, and AI analysis results.

2. **Patient Management**:
   - Accept or reject patient requests for treatment.
   - View AI-recommended treatment regimens and medications.

3. **Cured Patient Tracking**:
   - Maintain a record of successfully treated patients for reporting and analysis.

4. **Telemedicine Integration**:
   - Real-time video consultations and messaging with patients using Flask-SocketIO and WebRTC.

### **General Application Features**
1. **Offline Functionality**:
   - Works offline using edge AI technologies.
   - Sync patient data to the server when connectivity is restored.

2. **Advanced Diagnostics**:
   - Genomic analysis for identifying drug-resistant TB strains (MDR-TB/XDR-TB).

3. **Community Screening Tools**:
   - Risk assessment questionnaires or smartphone-based tools for community health workers.

4. **Integration with National Guidelines**:
   - Align recommendations with national TB protocols (e.g., NITRD, WHO).
